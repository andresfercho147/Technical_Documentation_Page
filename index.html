                <p>
                    C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note Câ™¯, but written with the number sign)[b] is a
                    general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped,
                    imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented
                    programming disciplines
                </p>

                <p>
                    C# was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative and later approved as an
                    international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. It was designed
                    by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen, being one of the
                    programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). The most recent version
                    is 9.0, which was released in 2020 in .NET 5.0 and included in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Ecma standard lists these design goals for C#:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The language is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming
                        language.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The language, and implementations thereof, should provide support for software engineering
                        principles such as strong type checking, array bounds checking, detection of attempts to use
                        uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection. Software robustness, durability, and
                        programmer productivity are important.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The language is intended for use in developing software components suitable for deployment in
                        distributed environments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        C# is intended to be suitable for writing applications for both hosted and embedded systems,
                        ranging from the very large that use sophisticated operating systems, down to the very small
                        having dedicated functions.

            <header>A tour of the C# language</header>
            <article>
                <p>During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a
                    managed code compiler system called "Simple Managed C" (SMC).[20][21] In January 1999, Anders
                    Hejlsberg formed a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like
                    Object Oriented Language".[22] Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of
                    the language, but chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was
                    publicly announced at the July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been
                    renamed C#, and the class libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.</p>
                <p>Hejlsberg is C#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft, and was previously involved
                    with the design of Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi (formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise Delphi and
                    Borland Delphi), and Visual J++. In interviews and technical papers he has stated that flaws in
                    most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) drove the fundamentals of
                    the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which, in turn, drove the design of the C# language itself.
                </p>
                <p>James Gosling, who created the Java programming language in 1994, and Bill Joy, a co-founder of Sun
                    Microsystems, the originator of Java, called C# an "imitation" of Java; Gosling further said that
                    "[C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted."[24][25] Klaus Kreft and
                    Angelika Langer (authors of a C++ streams book) stated in a blog post that "Java and C# are almost
                    identical programming languages. Boring repetition that lacks innovation,"[26] "Hardly anybody will
                    claim that Java or C# are revolutionary programming languages that changed the way we write
                    programs," and "C# borrowed a lot from Java - and vice versa. Now that C# supports boxing and
                    unboxing, we'll have a very similar feature in Java."[27] In July 2000, Hejlsberg said that C# is
                    "not a Java clone" and is "much closer to C++" in its design.</p>
                <p> Since the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on increasingly
                    divergent trajectories, becoming two quite different languages. One of the first major departures
                    came with the addition of generics to both languages, with vastly different implementations. C#
                    makes use of reification to provide "first-class" generic objects that can be used like any other
                    class, with code generation performed at class-load time.[29] Furthermore, C# has added several
                    major features to accommodate functional-style programming, culminating in the LINQ extensions
                    released with C# 3.0 and its supporting framework of lambda expressions, extension methods, and
                    anonymous types.[30] These features enable C# programmers to use functional programming techniques,
                    such as closures, when it is advantageous to their application. The LINQ extensions and the
                    functional imports help developers reduce the amount of boilerplate code that is included in common
                    tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching through a data structure, shifting
                    the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve readability and maintainability.</p>

                <p>
                    The core syntax of the C# language is similar to that of other C-style languages such as C, C++ and
                    Java, particularly:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Semicolons are used to denote the end of a statement.</li>
                    <li>Curly brackets are used to group statements. Statements are commonly grouped into methods
                        (functions), methods into classes, and classes into namespaces.</li>
                    <li>Variables are assigned using an equals sign, but compared using two consecutive equals signs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Square brackets are used with arrays, both to declare them and to get a value at a given index
                        in one of them.</li>

            <article>
                The following is a very simple C# program, a version of the classic "Hello world" example:
                <code>using System; // A version of the
 classic "Hello World" program class Program
            {
                        public static void Main(string[] args)
                        {
                            Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
                        }
                    }
            </code>

                This code will display this text in the console window:

                    Variables are containers for storing data values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In C#, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>int</span>stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
                    <li><span>double</span>stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
                    <li><span>char</span>stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by
                        single quotes</li>
                    <li><span>string</span> stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double
                        quotes</li>
                    <li><span>bool</span>stores values with two states: true or false</li>

            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <article>
                o create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:
                <code>type variableName = value;</code>
                <p>
                    Where type is a C# type (such as int or string), and variableName is the name of the variable (such
                    as <span>int</span> or <span>string</span> ). The equal sign is used to assign values to the
                    variable.
                </p>

            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    However, you can add the const keyword if you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing
                    values (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):
                </p>


                <p>
                    Example:
                </p>
                <code>const int myNum = 15;
myNum = 20; // error</code>
                <p>The <span>const</span> keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, so
                    that others (or yourself) won't mess up your code. An example that is often referred to as a
                    constant, is PI (3.14159...).</p>
                <p><strong>Note: </strong>You cannot declare a constant variable without assigning the value. If you do,
                    an error will occur: <span>A const field requires a value to be provided.</span></p>

            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
                <p>A data type specifies the size and type of variable values. It is important to use the correct data
                    type for the corresponding variable; to avoid errors, to save time and memory, but it will also make
                    your code more maintainable and readable. The most common data types are:</p>


                <p>Seven data types that are primitives:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>int</span> 4 bytes. Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.</li>
                    <li>
                        <span>long</span> 8 bytes. Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to
                        9,223,372,036,854,775,807
                    </li>
                    <li><span>float</span> 4 bytes. Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal
                        digits.</li>
                    <li><span>double</span>8 bytes. Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>bool</span>1 bit. Stores true or false values.</li>
                    <li>
                        <span>char</span>2 bytes Stores a single character/letter, surrounded by single quotes.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>string</span>2 bytes per character. Stores a sequence of characters, surrounded by double
                        quotes.</li>
                </ul>




                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
                your application can perform.

                <ul>

                <code>if (20 > 18) 
                    {
                      Console.WriteLine("20 is greater than 18");
                    }</code>

            <article>
                Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
                Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
                <p>Syntax</p>

                <code>while (condition) 
                    {
                      // code block to be executed
                    }</code> In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a
                variable (i) is less than 5:

                Example:

                <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

                <code>int i = 0;
                    while (i &lt; 5) 
                    {
                      Console.WriteLine(i);
                      i++;
                    }</code>

            <article>
                When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the <span>for</span>
                loop instead of a <span>while</span> loop:
                <p>Syntax</p>
                <code>for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) 
                    {
                      // code block to be executed
                    }</code>
                <p><strong>Statement 1</strong> is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 2</strong> defines the condition for executing the code block.</p>
                <p><strong>Statement 3</strong> is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.</p>
                The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:
                <code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) 
                        {
                          Console.WriteLine(i);
                        }</code>

            <header>Break and Continue</header>
            <article>
                You have already seen the <span>break</span> statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. It
                was used to "jump out" of a <span>switch</span> statement.

                The <span>break</span> statement can also be used to jump out of a <strong>loop.</strong>

                This example jumps out of the loop when <span>i</span> is equal to <span> 4</span>:
                <p>Example:</p>
                <code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) 
                    {
                      if (i == 4) 
                      {
                        break;
                      }
                      Console.WriteLine(i);
                    }</code>
                You can also use <span>break</span> and <span>continue</span> continue in while loops:
                <code>int i = 0;
                        while (i &lt; 10) 
                        {
                          Console.WriteLine(i);
                          i++;
                          if (i == 4) 
                          {
                            break;
                          }
                        }</code>

                <p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate
                    variables for each value.</p>
                <p>To declare an array, define the variable type with <strong> square brackets:</strong></p>
                <code>string[] cars;</code>
                <p>We have now declared a variable that holds an array of strings.</p>
                <p>To insert values to it, we can use an array literal - place the values in a comma-separated list,
                    inside curly braces:</p>
                <code>string[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};</code>
                <p>To create an array of integers, you could write:</p>
                <code>int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};</code>
